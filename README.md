<h1 align="ceter"> Discord-bot WeebWatcher</h1>

<h3 align="left"> This project was inspired by a desire to learn more JavaScript and in turn learn about Docker, and CI/CD. This bot currently implements features such as custom commands for playing music, creating a queue through Billboard's Top 100, player management, a database to keep track of in-guild currencies, and a few commands to mess with your friends. Still in production for more features.
Learning Outcomes:
  - OOP practice using discord.js (a Node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API).
  - How to build and deploy using Docker, which involved creating Dockerfiles, managing Docker containers, and understanding container     
    orchestration.
